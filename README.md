-----------------------------------------

*Piano
	--plays a different tone for each button pressed

*Color Sensor
	--provides numerical output of colors detected by sensor
	--could not find documentation on how EV3 numbers correlate to colors, 
	  so the output is numerical

	--Plays distinct connect & disconnect tones
	--Partially implemented beeping backup tone, but had issues with it interfering
	  with controls, so not fully connected
